# Recipes

## Introduction

### Summary

This is a project from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
Its goal is to demonstrate HTML knowledge.

### Description

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s
important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML
chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

## Skills Demonstrated

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Git
